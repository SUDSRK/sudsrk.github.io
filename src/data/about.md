# Intro

I am a Founding Engineer at [Natoe.ai](https://natoe.ai), where I led the development of the entire MVP, transforming it into a fully-fledged product from the ground up. Before Natoe.ai, I was the Lead Frontend Engineer at [Food Darzee](https://fooddarzee.com), where I developed websites and applications that have helped over 100,000+ customers lead healthier lives and achieve their fitness goals. Prior to that, I worked as a Machine Learning and Full Stack Developer at [ML Infomap](https://mlinfomap.com).

In my spare time, I enjoy learning new technologies, playing games, and working on small freelance projects. If you think I can be helpful to you or your project, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d love to connect!
